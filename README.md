# vmc-teleconf-app
I had particpated in the Teleconferencing App Secure Design Hackathon organized by OWASP WIA Committee NYC Chapter.
Event link: https://www.meetup.com/womeninappsec/events/273377970/
There I had presented my idea and design of a secure Teleconferencing App
The basic design and decision making process of the features are attached in a PDF.
Now we are planning to move forward with the idea. Suvidha Pankar who was also a participant is collaborating with me.
Next steps is establishing a RASCI, detailed connectivity diagrams of various features, deciding on the technology stack, using a CPaaS provider to integrate various modules and scouting for more members to collaborate with.
